/**
 * The slice managing API fetching/result caching. Should not be used
 * outside of the data store. If you want to work with the API, look
 * at the exports of the other files in this module.
 * 
 * While this is a slice, it has no internal state that we declared.
 * RTK handles effectively all of this and exposes API hooks for us that
 * are nearly equivalent to something like React Query.
 * 
 * If you need to connect to a new API, you will need to create a new slice
 * (and corresponding) interfaces, import this slice, and then call `injectEndpoints`
 * on it with the new endpoint URL and types. You will also need to add a new tag
 * to tagTypes here, and use the same tag in the new slice. You can find other
 * examples in the codebase if this is a bit confusing.
